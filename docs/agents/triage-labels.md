# Triage Label Mapping

Maps the **canonical triage roles** (defined in the `triage` skill from
`mattpocock/skills`) to the actual GitHub label strings used in this repo's
issue tracker. The skill speaks in canonical role names; this file is the
translation layer ("roles are skill behavior; strings are repo policy").

> **See also:** [`docs/maintainers.md`](../maintainers.md) — triage workflow
> procedure (how to apply labels, when to close, etc.).

| Label in `mattpocock/skills` | Label in our tracker | Meaning |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| `bug`                        | `bug`                | Something is broken |
| `enhancement`                | `enhancement`        | New feature or improvement |
| `needs-triage`               | *(unlabeled)*        | Maintainer needs to evaluate |
| `needs-info`                 | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`            | `good-to-code`       | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent |
| `ready-for-human`            | `good-to-code`       | Needs human implementation |
| `wontfix`                    | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned |

## Notes

- `needs-triage` has **no label** by design: an unlabeled issue is implicitly in
  the `needs-triage` state.
- `ready-for-agent` and `ready-for-human` both map to `good-to-code`. The
  difference is who implements: an agent picks up `ready-for-agent`; a human
  implements `ready-for-human`. `status:in-review` is a separate human-review
  state (for when code already exists and awaits review) — do not apply it to
  issues that still need implementation.
- The following repo labels are intentionally **outside** the triage taxonomy
  and should not be applied by `/triage`:
  - `status:in-review` — human review state (optional overlay on `good-to-code`)
  - `release` — release management
  - `Share Your Thoughts` — open-ended community feedback
  - `community-preset` — community submission (applied via `preset_submission.yml` form)
