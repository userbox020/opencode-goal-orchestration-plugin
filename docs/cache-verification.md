# Cache verification

This project has four complementary layers. They answer different questions
and should not be conflated.

- **Continuous cache-safety tests** run in `bun test` (and therefore CI) and
  enforce the payload invariants directly against the hook pipeline. This is
  the first line of defense against cache regressions.
- **Deterministic payload verification** proves that this plugin projects a
  stable provider payload under a controlled local capture server. It does not
  measure a provider cache.
- **Live cache benchmarking** records telemetry returned by an already-running
  provider-backed OpenCode server. It is opt-in, provider-specific, and useful
  for comparing explicitly controlled arms; it is not a CI check or a general
  cache guarantee.
- **Runtime cache monitoring** watches provider-reported cache telemetry
  during real sessions and logs a warning when a cache bust signature appears.
- **Live cache smoke** (`bun run cache:smoke`) is a one-command operational
  probe: it starts a real `opencode serve` with your normal config/auth/plugin,
  runs short scripted conversations, and reports per-request provider cache
  telemetry with a verdict.

## Continuous cache-safety tests (CI)

Provider prompt caches are exact byte-prefix matches over the rendered
request. Instead of enumerating known-good payload shapes, these suites
assert the properties every transform must uphold, so they also catch
mistakes that have not been made before:

- `src/hooks/cache-safety.property.test.ts` — re-renders a growing
  conversation through the real transform pipeline (mirroring the
  composition in `src/index.ts`) and asserts turn-over-turn byte-prefix
  stability, isolation of volatile content to the tagged trailing message,
  determinism under wall-clock/randomness changes, and pass-through of
  specialist payloads. A drift guard fails when `src/index.ts` gains, loses,
  or reorders transform steps without the suite being updated.
- `src/hooks/cache-payload.snapshot.test.ts` — golden snapshots of every
  prompt surface the plugin injects (phase reminder, orchestrator system
  prompt, canonical transformed payload). A failure means the change will
  invalidate provider caches for existing sessions once; update deliberately
  with `bun test --update-snapshots` so the PR diff documents the impact.
- `src/cache-safety-tripwire.test.ts` — scans prompt-assembly directories
  for volatile-input patterns (`Date.now`, `new Date`, `Math.random`,
  `randomUUID`, `performance.now`) outside a justified allowlist.

All hook injections must go through `src/hooks/cache-safe-injection.ts`; see
the Prompt Cache Safety section in `AGENTS.md` for the authoring rules.

## Live cache smoke (`bun run cache:smoke`)

Answers "is provider prompt caching working in my setup right now?" at the
cost of a handful of real requests. It starts an isolated `opencode serve`
(your global config, auth, and plugin apply), runs scripted scenarios in
fresh sessions, then reads `tokens.cache.read/write` from the stored
assistant messages — including the subagent child sessions that delegation
scenarios spawn.

Each scenario is designed to fire specific plugin payload machinery:

| Scenario | Triggers | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `plain` | phase reminder, skills filter, system transform | ✅ |
| `tools` | tool-result growth across steps | ✅ |
| `nudge` | post-file-tool nudge injection, phase-reminder equilibrium | extensive |
| `todos` | todowrite churn (create/update/complete across turns) | extensive |
| `long` | sliding cache breakpoints over a six-turn history | extensive |
| `board` | job-board trailing injection, injected completion, reconcile | extensive |
| `board-churn` | board strip/re-append across many turns; plateau detection (issue #874) | extensive |
| `running-lane` | running task tool_result mid-history across consecutive requests (PR #871) | extensive |
| `agents` | repeated delegation, task-session reuse, subagent caching | extensive |

```bash
bun run cache:smoke                          # plain + tools (fast, cheap)
bun run cache:smoke -- --scenario extensive  # full matrix, several minutes
bun run cache:smoke -- --scenario board,agents
bun run cache:smoke -- --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-5
bun run cache:smoke -- --server http://127.0.0.1:4096   # reuse a running server

# Issue #874 A/B: pin the board strategy via a scratch project config
bun run cache:smoke -- --scenario board-churn --board-strategy latest
bun run cache:smoke -- --scenario board-churn --board-strategy checkpoint-compatible
```

Two failure signatures are detected, plus an inconclusive case:

- A request is flagged **SUSPECT** when it is not the first request of its
  session, its input is ≥4096 tokens (above every provider's minimum
  cacheable prefix), and it read zero cached tokens — the bust signature.
- A session is flagged **plateau** when `cache-read` stays frozen at the
  same nonzero value for 3+ consecutive requests while ≥6144 uncached input
  tokens accumulate — the issue #874 signature, where the reusable prefix
  stops growing even though nothing reads zero.

Exit codes: `0` caching works, `1` bust or plateau detected, `2` inconclusive
(provider reported no cache telemetry), `3` setup error. Providers with
read-only telemetry (OpenAI-style `cached_tokens`) show `cache-write 0` —
normal, not a failure.

## Runtime cache monitoring

`src/hooks/cache-monitor/` observes `message.updated` events and the
provider-reported `tokens.cache.read` / `tokens.cache.write` counters. It
logs three warning shapes (observation only, to the plugin log):

- `possible prompt-cache bust` — a session that previously hit the cache
  reports zero cache-read tokens on a sizeable request (once per bust
  streak). The signature of a mid-session prompt-prefix change.
- `never hit the provider cache` — a session reports zero cached tokens on
  every sizeable request from its first turn, past both a consecutive-request
  and a cumulative-uncached-input threshold (once per session). The signature
  of a prefix that changes on *every* request — how the v2.2.5
  checkpoint-board regression looked in the field. OpenCode coalesces missing
  provider telemetry to zeros, so a cache-less provider is indistinguishable
  from this; the thresholds and hedged wording keep that ambiguity from
  becoming noise, and modest sessions on cache-less providers stay silent.
- `cache-read plateau` — reads frozen at the same nonzero value for 4+
  consecutive requests while ≥50K uncached input tokens accumulate (once per
  plateau; re-arms when the read value changes). The issue #874 signature:
  the reusable prefix has stopped growing even though nothing reads zero.
  The warning suggests trying `backgroundJobs.strategy`
  `"checkpoint-compatible"`.

This is the field safety net for provider-side behavior no offline test can
model.

## Prerequisites

Install dependencies and build the local plugin before either check:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

The deterministic harness requires a separately pre-provisioned absolute path
to **exactly** `opencode-ai@1.18.2`. It deliberately does not install the host
binary or dependencies itself.

## Offline deterministic payload verification

Run the harness with the pre-provisioned host binary:

```bash
OPENCODE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/node_modules/.bin/opencode \
  bun run verify:cache-stability
```

The script rejects a missing, non-absolute, nonexistent, or non-`1.18.2`
`OPENCODE_BIN`. It uses the built local plugin and a local capture provider,
disables Bun auto-install, and makes no external provider or dependency
resolution network calls.

It asserts the deterministic request shape, including:

- exactly four primary/orchestrator model requests;
- stable system, tool, and option projections across those requests;
- append-only, prefix-stable conversation input and historical transformed user
  prompts;
- exactly one phase reminder in each eligible user projection, with no reminder
  marker in system instructions;
- availability and transcript execution results for `read` and `todowrite`.

Passing this check demonstrates payload stability under the fixture. It does
not establish that any external model provider accepted or reused a cache
prefix.

## Opt-in live cache benchmark

The runner talks directly to an existing OpenCode HTTP server. It does not
start a server, load credentials, or use the SDK. The required CLI contract is:

```bash
bun scripts/benchmark-opencode-cache.ts \
  --server http://127.0.0.1:4096 \
  --provider PROVIDER_ID \
  --model MODEL_ID \
  --runs N \
  --output /safe/output.json \
  --arm ARM_ID \
  --plugin-build BUILD_ID
```

`--server`, `--provider`, `--model`, `--runs`, `--output`, `--arm`, and
`--plugin-build` are required. Harmless timing/retry controls have defaults:
`--timeout-ms` (120000), `--retries` (2), and `--retry-delay-ms` (500).
Use repeated `--header NAME:VALUE` only when the already-running server needs
an HTTP header; headers are not persisted. `--overwrite` permits replacing an
existing output file.

Each fresh session targets `orchestrator` and the requested provider/model. The
fixed sequence requires `Read(package.json)`, a completed `TodoWrite`, a final
answer, and a second user follow-up. The runner establishes SSE coverage before
prompting, deletes every created session, and records discards rather than
resampling. Retry, compaction, routing mismatch, incomplete trace, stream
coverage failure, and assistant/provider errors all invalidate a session.

### Zen free example

For OpenCode Zen free routing, use provider `opencode` and model `hy3-free`.
Keep credentials outside the repository, in the environment of an isolated
server process. In the isolated OpenCode configuration, make model selection
explicit and disable title generation so its separate small-model request does
not confound the run:

```json
{
  "preset": "opencode-zen-free",
  "default_agent": "orchestrator",
  "model": "opencode/hy3-free",
  "small_model": "opencode/hy3-free",
  "agent": {
    "orchestrator": { "model": "opencode/hy3-free" },
    "title": { "disable": true }
  }
}
```

With that isolated server running, a live invocation is:

```bash
bun scripts/benchmark-opencode-cache.ts \
  --server http://127.0.0.1:4096 \
  --provider opencode \
  --model hy3-free \
  --runs 12 \
  --arm current \
  --plugin-build "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --output /tmp/opencode-zen-hy3-current.json
```

## Report interpretation

The JSON report is intentionally redacted. It excludes prompt and response
text, request bodies, tool inputs/outputs, workspace paths, headers, nonce
values, and raw event properties. It retains normalized routing, tool status,
safe assistant/provider error-code classifications, cache token telemetry,
timing observations, discard reasons, and comparison metadata.

Request observations preserve cache fields as `null` when the provider did not
report them; `null` is not a cache miss. `totalInput` is only defined when it
can be reconstructed as `input + cacheRead + cacheWrite`. Position one in each
eligible session is preserved as raw warm-up data but excluded from aggregate
cache and timing metrics.

The primary metric block contains session-clustered bootstrap 95% confidence
intervals for warm-up-excluded zero-cache miss rate, cache coverage,
prompt-loop TTFT p50, and prompt-loop latency p50. Prompt-loop timings are one
observation per submitted user turn, not duplicated over provider steps.
`eligiblePrefixCoverage` is only meaningful when the provider reports enough
telemetry to calculate it; otherwise treat it as unavailable.

## Methodology and limits

Use the same OpenCode host version, workspace fixture, provider configuration,
agent/model routing, and runner revision for every arm. Build or package each
plugin arm equivalently, run a one-session clean preflight per arm, then run
separate baseline and current arms. Compare the resulting redacted reports;
do not mix arms in one server or silently replace discarded sessions.

This is not CI. Provider cache semantics, free-route policy, cache TTL,
capacity, model revisions, entitlement, and routing can change independently
of this repository. A live result is evidence for its recorded environment,
not a portable performance claim.

## Observed #784 controlled Zen HY3 result

The following is an **environment-specific** controlled observation, not a
guarantee. It used isolated OpenCode `1.18.2` hosts, preset
`opencode-zen-free`, title generation disabled, `opencode/hy3-free` routing,
the fixed tool trace, and 12 independent eligible sessions per arm.

| Metric | Baseline `67e2a556` | Current `08e9fa5` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Eligible / discarded sessions | 12 / 0 | 12 / 0 |
| Warm-up-excluded request observations | 24 | 24 |
| Zero-cache miss rate (95% CI) | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 0.000 [0.000, 0.000] |
| Cache coverage (95% CI) | 0.000 [0.000, 0.000] | 0.941345 [0.940887, 0.942179] |
| Median eligible-prefix coverage | 0.000000 | 0.903893 |
| Cache read / write tokens | 0 / 0 | 397760 / 0 |
| Prompt-loop TTFT p50 ms (95% CI) | 2915.24 [2883.83, 2983.40] | 2115.54 [2033.55, 2326.98] |
| Prompt-loop latency p50 ms (95% CI) | 3216.77 [3072.35, 3255.93] | 2267.81 [2248.48, 3012.78] |

Every eligible session completed `read` and `todowrite`; observed routing was
`orchestrator` / `opencode` / `hy3-free`. Repeat the controlled procedure
before drawing conclusions under a different provider account, host, model
revision, or cache policy.

## Observed OpenAI manual verification

This single-session manual smoke result is **not** a baseline comparison. It
used an isolated host with existing local OpenAI authentication, the current
plugin build, and `openai/gpt-5.6-terra-fast`.

| Metric | Observed value |
| --- | ---: |
| Eligible sessions | 1 |
| Cache-read tokens after warm-up | 12288, 13824, 14336 |
| Warm-up-excluded cache coverage | 93.33% |
| Eligible-prefix coverage | 85.64% |
| Second-turn prompt-loop TTFT | 1983.02 ms |
| Second-turn prompt-loop latency | 2278.46 ms |

The required `read` and `todowrite` trace completed with no assistant or
provider error. Repeat a controlled baseline/current comparison before making
a provider-wide performance claim.
