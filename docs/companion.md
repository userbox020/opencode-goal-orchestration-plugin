# Desktop Companion App

The desktop companion app provides a floating status overlay showing running and active agents.

## How to Enable in Configuration

You can enable the companion by adding a `companion` section to your setting configuration file (`~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` or `.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "companion": {
    "enabled": true,
    "binaryPath": "/path/to/oh-my-opencode-slim-companion",
    "position": "bottom-right",
    "size": "medium",
    "gifPack": "default",
    "loopStyle": "classic",
    "speed": 1,
    "debug": false
  }
}
```

### Supported Values

- **`companion.position`**:
  - `bottom-right` (default)
  - `bottom-left`
  - `top-right`
  - `top-left`

- **`companion.size`**:
  - `small` (80px)
  - `medium` (120px) (default)
  - `large` (160px)

- **`companion.gifPack`**:
  - `default` (default) - the bundled companion animation set generated from
    the MP4 sources in `companion/VIDEOS/`.

- **`companion.loopStyle`**:
  - `classic` (default) - forward playback that loops back to the first frame.
  - `smooth` - ping-pong playback that reverses direction at the end for a
    smoother transition.

- **`companion.speed`**: optional animation playback speed multiplier from `0.25` to
  `4`. The default is `1`. Values above `1` play faster; values below `1`
  play slower.

- **`companion.debug`**: set to `true` to enable verbose native companion debug
  logs while troubleshooting window/session behavior. Logs are written under
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/log/` or `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`.

- **`companion.binaryPath`**: optional path to a custom companion binary. When
  set, the runtime launches this binary instead of the default install path.
  Custom binaries are user-managed and are not replaced by automatic companion
  updates.

### Remembered Window Position

You can drag the companion window to a custom location. The companion remembers
the last dragged position per project and restores it the next time that project
opens. If no custom position is saved for a project, the configured
`companion.position` corner is used.

Saved positions are clamped to the current screen so the companion stays visible
after monitor or resolution changes.

## Installer Flag

During interactive installation, the installer asks whether to download and
enable the native Companion binary. The prompt defaults to `no`, so pressing
Enter skips it.

On niri, Companion can install normally when enabled now that the native binary
is fixed.

Companion installation is best-effort. If the binary cannot be downloaded or
installed, the installer prints a warning and continues installing the core
plugin without Companion enabled.

For automation, pass `--companion=yes` to install without prompting:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --companion=yes
```

Pass `--companion=no` to skip the native binary and omit the config block.

## niri support status

The native `companion-v0.1.3` binary works on niri and exposes a stable
Wayland app-id/title: `oh-my-opencode-slim-companion`.

niri users who want the Companion to behave like an overlay should add a window
rule to their niri config, for example:

```kdl
window-rule {
    match app-id=r"^oh-my-opencode-slim-companion$"
    match title=r"^oh-my-opencode-slim-companion$"
    open-floating true
    open-focused false
    default-floating-position x=16 y=16 relative-to="bottom-right"
}
```

The rule is optional, but without `open-floating true` niri may tile the
Companion like any other regular xdg-toplevel window. Adjust the `x`/`y` gap or
`relative-to` corner if you prefer a different placement.

Run diagnostics with:

```bash
oh-my-opencode-slim doctor
```

---

## Expected Binary Install Path

The runtime looks for the companion binary at:

```text
$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/storage/oh-my-opencode-slim/bin/oh-my-opencode-slim-companion
```

If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset, this resolves to:

```text
~/.local/share/opencode/storage/oh-my-opencode-slim/bin/oh-my-opencode-slim-companion
```

If the binary is not located in this directory, set `companion.binaryPath` to
the binary you want the plugin runtime to launch.

When Companion is enabled and uses the default install path, the plugin keeps
the native binary aligned with the companion version bundled by the installed
plugin package. The updater writes install metadata beside the binary so future
starts can skip unnecessary downloads. Existing `companion-v0.1.2` installs that
predate metadata are migrated in place without re-downloading.

Startup checks run before the Companion is spawned, but they use a short timeout
so OpenCode startup is not blocked by a slow network. Plugin auto-update also
tries to update the Companion binary after the new package is installed. If a
download fails, the plugin update still succeeds and Companion update is retried
on the next OpenCode restart. The updater uses a lock to prevent concurrent
OpenCode processes from replacing the same binary, and stale locks from crashed
updates are cleaned up automatically.

Automatic native updates only use release archives listed in the packaged
companion manifest, and every archive must have a matching SHA256 checksum.
Custom binaries configured with `companion.binaryPath` are never overwritten.

## V2 Release Strategy

For the desktop companion app, the release workflow follows the V2 distribution
plan:

1. **GitHub Release Assets**: companion binaries are uploaded to the
   `companion-v0.1.3` GitHub release.
2. **Separate Companion Versioning**: the companion uses its own version so the
   plugin can ship beta updates without rebuilding native binaries every time.
3. **OS/Arch Detection**: `--companion=yes` selects the archive for the current
   target.
4. **Manifest + Checksums**: the plugin ships
   `src/companion/companion-manifest.json`, which names the companion release
   and SHA256 checksum for each supported archive.
5. **No R2 Required**: GitHub Releases are the source of truth. R2 can be added
   later as a mirror if download volume becomes a problem.

Current release assets are named:

```text
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

Supported installer targets:

- macOS arm64: `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- macOS x64: `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- Linux x64: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Linux arm64: `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Windows x64: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

## Maintainer Release Process

Companion binaries are **not** built on every plugin beta. The workflow is
manual-only so GitHub runner usage stays under maintainer control.

Run a companion release only when the Rust companion changes or when the state
protocol expected by the plugin changes.

### 1. Choose the companion version

The first companion release is:

```text
0.1.2
```

The matching GitHub release tag is:

```text
companion-v0.1.3
```

The installer currently downloads from that tag.

### 2. Trigger selected target builds manually

Build only the targets you want to pay for. Start with your current platform if
you are testing the release path:

```bash
gh workflow run companion-release.yml \
  -f version=0.1.3 \
  -f targets=macos-arm64
```

Build multiple targets by passing a comma-separated list:

```bash
gh workflow run companion-release.yml \
  -f version=0.1.3 \
  -f targets=macos-arm64,macos-x64,linux-x64,linux-arm64,windows-x64
```

Supported workflow target names:

```text
macos-arm64
macos-x64
linux-x64
linux-arm64
windows-x64
```

The workflow creates or updates the `companion-v<version>` release and uploads
the selected archives.

### 3. Verify release assets

After the workflow finishes:

```bash
gh release view companion-v0.1.3
```

Confirm the release contains the archive names expected by the installer for the
targets you built. Then update `src/companion/companion-manifest.json` with the
new version, tag, and each asset's SHA256 digest. GitHub release asset metadata
includes `digest: sha256:<hash>`, which can be copied into the manifest without
the `sha256:` prefix.

The runtime updater has a matching manifest constant in
`src/companion/updater.ts`; tests assert the JSON manifest and runtime constant
stay in sync.

### 4. Install with the plugin installer

Once the release assets exist, users can run:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@beta install --companion=yes
```

The installer detects the user's OS/architecture, downloads the matching archive
from `companion-v0.1.3`, installs it to the runtime binary path, and writes the
companion config block. If the companion install fails, the core plugin install
continues without enabling Companion.

### Cost controls

- The workflow uses `workflow_dispatch` only. It never runs on push, PR, or tag.
- Build a single target while testing.
- Reuse one companion release across many plugin betas.
- Add more targets only when you are ready to support those users.
