- Shell is acceptable for bulk or mechanical filesystem changes when it is clearer or safer than many individual edits (for example: truncate generated logs, remove build artifacts, batch rename/move files), especially when the user explicitly asks for that shell operation.
- Before destructive or broad shell operations, verify the target set and quote paths. Prefer a dry-run/listing first when practical.
